# üöÄ Improvements
The original WolfLease lacks tons of features, users cannot login and authenticate, frontend and the UI was missing, scalable deployment via AWS...etc..

WolfLease previously also lacked essential features like a user-friendly interface, secure data management, and full CRUD functionality. To improve this, we modernized the UI/UX, added login validations, and implemented full CRUD operations, giving users greater control. We also deployed the platform to the cloud for better accessibility and integrated a database to manage data effectively, enhancing security and consistency.

With WolfLease 2.0 we solved all the problems with these improvements.

- UI/UX Enhancement: Redesigned the user interface with a modern login page featuring validation, improving usability and security.
- CRUD Operations: Added full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete listings and profiles for enhanced content control.
- Cloud Hosting: Deployed the application on AWS, enabling improved accessibility and scalability for a larger user base.
- Login Validations: Integrated robust validation checks in the login process to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.
- Database Integration: Incorporated a database to manage and store user data effectively, ensuring data consistency and support for complex queries.

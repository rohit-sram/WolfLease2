# 🚀 Improvements
The original WolfLease lacks tons of features, users cannot login and authenticate, frontend and the UI was missing, scalable deployment via AWS...etc..

WolfLease previously also lacked essential features like a user-friendly interface, secure data management, and full CRUD functionality. To improve this, we modernized the UI/UX, added login validations, and implemented full CRUD operations, giving users greater control. We also deployed the platform to the cloud for better accessibility and integrated a database to manage data effectively, enhancing security and consistency.

With WolfLease 2.0 we solved all the problems with these improvements.

- UI/UX Enhancement: Redesigned the user interface with a modern login page featuring validation, improving usability and security.
- CRUD Operations: Added full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete listings and profiles for enhanced content control.
- Cloud Hosting: Deployed the application on AWS, enabling improved accessibility and scalability for a larger user base.
- Login Validations: Integrated robust validation checks in the login process to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.
- Database Integration: Incorporated a database to manage and store user data effectively, ensuring data consistency and support for complex queries.
